--1.      Create a view named “view_product_order_[your_last_name]”, list all products and total ordered quantity for that product.
create view view_product_order_Li as 
select p.ProductID, ProductName,Quantity
from Products p left join [Order Details] od on p.ProductID=od.ProductID

--2.      Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_quantity_[your_last_name]” that accept product id as an input and total quantities of order as output parameter.
create procedure sp_product_order_quantity_Li @productId int
AS
select ProductID,Quantity 
from [Order Details]
where ProductID=@productId

--3.Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_city_[your_last_name]” that accept product name as an input and top 5 cities that ordered most that product combined with the total quantity of that product ordered from that city as output.
create procedure sp_product_order_city_Li @productName Varchar(100)
AS
select top 5 p.ProductName,o.ShipCity,od.Quantity
from Orders o join [Order Details] od on o.OrderID=od.OrderID join Products p on p.ProductID=od.ProductID
where ProductName=@productName
order by Quantity desc

--4.Create 2 new tables “people_your_last_name” “city_your_last_name”. City table has two records: {Id:1, City: Seattle}, {Id:2, City: Green Bay}. People has three records: {id:1, Name: Aaron Rodgers, City: 2}, {id:2, Name: Russell Wilson, City:1}, {Id: 3, Name: Jody Nelson, City:2}. 
--Remove city of Seattle. If there was anyone from Seattle, put them into a new city “Madison”. Create a view “Packers_your_name” lists all people from Green Bay. If any error occurred, no changes should be made to DB. (after test) Drop both tables and view.
create table city_Li(
Id int,
City varchar(255))
insert into city_Li (Id,City) values (1,'Seattle'),(2,'Green Bay')
create table people_Li(
Id int,
Name varchar(255),
City varchar(255))
insert into people_Li (Id,Name,City) values (1,'Aaron Rodgers',2),(2,'Russell Wilson',1),(3,'Jody Nelson',2)
--5.
--6..ow do you make sure two tables have the same data?
--I would use inner join to find out the intersaction of two tables, the result will return the data in common for the two tables.
